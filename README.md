# Harvard-Movielens
In this repository I will upload the code and the report of the Movielens project, where I try to obtain a precise recommendation system using 
the Movielens data. This submission has three parts: The R code where I adjusted de model (movielens_code.R), the report in form of a pdf document
(movielens_report_code.pdf) which summarizes  the calculations done and add some visual information and the Rmd code (movielens_report_code.Rmd)
which shows how the report has been created.
